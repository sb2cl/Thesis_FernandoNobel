### Definition of ProteinInduced. ###

import 'ex03_protein_constitutive.one'

## ProteinInduced extends the ProteinConstitutive model to make ##
## the expression inducible by a transcription factor.          ##
model ProteinInduced(ProteinConstitutive)

  input TF       # Define the transcription factor as an input.
  species k_m=0  # Override the parameter k_m to be a species.
  
  parameter
    h = 1        # Half-activation threshold.
    k_m_max = 1  # Maximum transcription rate.
  end
  
  # Set the value of k_m as an substitution equation.
  rule k_m := k_m_max * TF/(TF+h)
end

## Example of how to use ProteinInduced. ##
standalone
  A = ProteinConstitutive()
  B = ProteinInduced()

  rule B.TF := A.protein  # Set protein A as the transcription factor of B.
end
